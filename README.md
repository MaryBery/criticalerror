I wrote this site as a way for my laptop ensemble to advertise our talent as search for performance opportunities and for people to eventually find us on their own.
The library/recordings page is our way of displaying our works. I used JScript to make it so you could click the name of the desired piece and it would change the video that shows on the page.
The ensemble page gives the bios for each member of the ensemble, and it uses the same JScript format for showing the bios as the library/recordings page does with its videos.
The contact page uses a link to formsubmit.co to deliver messages from those looking to communicate with us.
I wrote this with html,css, and JScript
